# Ukraine War Heatmap
This project takes news about Ukraine from subreddits like r/CombatFootage, r/UkraineWarVideoReport, r/ukraine, r/worldnews, r/UkraineInvasionVideos and r/UkrainevRussia and translates them into a heatmap where most of the stuff related to the war in Ukraine is happening.
You can see that heatmap [here](https://ruarq.github.io/ukraine-war-heatmap/). It updates every 30 minutes.
